// Returning Strings

// Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".

// [Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]


function greet(name){
  let input = name
  return `Hello, ${input} how are you doing today?`
}
// Alternate 

// function greet(name){
//   return `Hello, ${name} how are you doing today?`;
// }
